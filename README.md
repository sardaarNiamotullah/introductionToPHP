### I have stored some introductory projects of PHP here during doing a [course](https://youtu.be/OK_JCtrrv-c) from freeCodeCamp.
<br><br>
During doing this course I have learned some basic things about the PHP programming language. Such as...
* Working with GET and Post method of HTML form.
* HTML form validation.
* Data type of PHP.
* Conditional Statements, Loops, and Function in PHP.
* Class, Objects, Constructors, Inheritance in PHP
* Getters, Setters, Comments, and many more.
